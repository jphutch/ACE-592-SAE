## Paavani's script for installing our class environment

## If you have trouble with permissions on your device: 

## Windows users: Run command prompt as Administrator

## Mac Users: run the following line of code
sudo chmod -R 775 /Users/paavanisachdeva/.conda ## Replace with location of where Anaconda is installed in your device


Step 1: open terminal / command prompt. If on windows, open command prompt as admin 

Step 2: Navigate to folder with class repo
  cd /Users/paavanisachdeva/Github/ACE-592-SAE

Step 3: make sure you have the latest version of the repo using git pull 

Step 4: Check existing environments — This is relevant if you tried to install the environment previously and saw errors. 
  conda env create -f environment.yml 

Step 5: Check if the environment is installed 
  conda info —envs 

Step 6: Activate the environment !
 conda activate ace-592-sae 

Step 7: Open and run any Jupyter notebook from class. You will be prompted to choose an environment. If the environment has installed properly, then you should be able to run the notebook without any package errors.
